## Developer code challenges

Please do not fork this repository for your solution as other candidates could see your code. 

If there are any prerequisites or setup steps to run your work, please include those in a readme and/or provide a setup script.

## Ways to submit your work

 * For micro challenges, one or more Github Gists can be used
